I first finished this idea in 2023.4 with python's pygame.After learning about that Unity will ask game producer for money,for the UnityRunTime installed,I decided to find another game engine.As result,I found godot.I made this idea with godot to get used to godot.To be honest,it is really simple,and,what'more,I can't make a real game with little item.But I need to make sth to prove that I am good at c#,so that I can find partner to make a bigger goal.Now I learn c# well and I can write a song,which sounded not bad.If you could draw a character,or any other thing will be ok,you can connect me and send an email to 1732688608@qq.com..I give a warm welcome to everyone.By the way,the music called"ui bgm.wav" is written by myself.
